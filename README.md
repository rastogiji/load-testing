# Sample HTTP Load Testing Tool with Go

My very first program written in Golang. It's a very primitive Load Testing script that makes concurrent HTTP(s) request to a website.

Used GoRoutines for Concurrency and Channels for communication from child goroutines to main goroutine.

I plan to add support for other HTTP Methods as well as support for headers as well.
